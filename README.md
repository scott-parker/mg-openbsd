mg
==

OpenBSD mg ported to Linux.

mg is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people who
can't (or don't want to) run emacs for one reason or another, or are not
familiar with the vi editor. It is compatible with emacs because there
shouldn't be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or vi.
